# Pig-Game 🎲

## Game Rules 🤓
- The game involves two players who take turns over multiple rounds.
- During a turn, a player rolls a die as many times as they choose, with each roll's result adding to their ROUND score. However, if a 1 is rolled, the entire ROUND score is forfeited, and the turn immediately passes to the other player.
- A player can decide to "Hold" instead of rolling, which secures their ROUND score by adding it to their GLOBAL score. The turn then passes to the other player.
- The game continues until a player’s GLOBAL score reaches 100 points, at which point they are declared the winner.
